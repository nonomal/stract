# 🏆 Thank you!

We truly stand on the shoulders of giants and this project would not have been even remotely feasible without them. An especially huge thank you to

- The authors and contributors of Tantivy for providing the inverted index library on which Stract is built.
- The commoncrawl organization for crawling the web and making the dataset readily available. Even though we have our own crawler now, commoncrawl has been a huge help in the early stages of development.
